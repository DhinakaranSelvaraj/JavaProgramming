Operators - it a symbol which will perform some operations.
---------

Ex: int a = 10;
	int b = 20;
	
	int result = a+b	// + is adding two numbers which is called operators. = is also one operator.

	+,= are operators
	a, b are operands. so the variables which are present inside the expression [a+b] along with the operators are called operands.
	
	
	
 Types of operators
 ------------------
  	1) Arithmetic Operators 
  		* : Multiplication
		/ : Division
		% : Modulo
		+ : Addition
		– : Subtraction
		
	2) Relational/Comparison operators 
		== : Equal to
		!= : Not Equal to
		<  : less than
		<= : less than or equal to
		>  : Greater than
		>= : Greater than or equal to
	
	3) Logical Operators 
		&& : Logical AND
		|| : Logical OR
		!  : Logical NOT
		
		X		Y		X&&Y		X||Y		!X		!Y
		------------------------------------------------
		True	True	True		True		False	False
		True	False	False		True		False	True
		False	True	False		True		True	False
		False	False	False		False		True	True
		
	4) Increment & Decrement operators
		++ : Increment operator
			Post-Increment: Value is first used for computing the result and then incremented.
			Pre-Increment: Value is incremented first, and then the result is computed.
		–– : Decrement operator
			Post-decrement: Value is first used for computing the result and then decremented.
			Pre-Decrement: The value is decremented first, and then the result is computed.
	
	5) Assignment Operator
		+= : for adding the left operand with the right operand and then assigning it to the variable on the left
		-= : for subtracting the right operand from the left operand and then assigning it to the variable on the left
		*= : for multiplying the left operand with the right operand and then assigning it to the variable on the left
		/= : for dividing the left operand by the right operand and then assigning it to the variable on the left
		%= : for assigning the modulo of the left operand by the right operand and then assigning it to the variable on the left
		
	6) Conditional/ternary Operator
		?: - condition ? if true : if false [The above statement means that if the condition evaluates to true, then execute the statements after the ‘?’ else execute the statements after the ‘:’]


Operators are divided into 3 category
1) Unary Operator -  means those operator we can use with single variable [++ -- += -= *= /= %= = !]
2) Binary Operator - means those operator we can use with two variables [+ - * % > >= < <= != == && ||]
3) Ternary Operator - means those operator we can use with three variables [Conditional/ternary Operator - condition ? if true : if false]
