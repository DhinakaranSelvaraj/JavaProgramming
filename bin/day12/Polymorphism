Polymorphism

	Poly -  Many
	Morphism - Forms

	One thing can have many forms.
	
 EX: Shape - Circle, Square, Triangle, Rectangle

	Shape - One thing
	Circle, Square, Triangle, Rectangle - Many forms

 Ex: Water - Vapor, Iceberg etc,..

We can achieve Polymorphism by using Overloading concepts. Overloading can applicable for Methods and Constructors

Method Overloading - We can create multiple methods with same name in same class.

void m1()
void m1()
void m1()

Polymorphism is a theory concept. Through Overloading we can achieve Polymorphism.

Rules for Methods Overloading:
1) Method names should be same
2) Number of Parameter should be different
3) Data type of Parameter should be different
4) Order of parameter should be different
