Data type - It represents the type of data

Whenever you want to store some data in a variable you have to specify the data type,/.

What are the DT available in JAVA?
We can divide that into two categories.
	1) Premitive
	2) Non-Premitive/Derived/Collections
	
1) Premitive Data types: [Starts with Lowercase]
	4 types to represent the numbers => byte, short, int, long -----> Number without decimal
	2 types to represent the decimal => float, double ---> Represent decimal number
	1 type for represent the single character => char ---> single quote
	1 type for represent boolean => true/false
	
	Depends of size of the data we use this data type for numbers and decimal

2) Non-Premitive/Derived/Collections: [Starts with Uppercase]
	1)String
	2)AllayList
	3)HashMap
	4)HashSet
	etc...
	
Premitive data type we use to store the single value at a time
[Ex: int stuid = 101;]

Non-Premitive: Single data type can hold different type of data (Multiple value into single variable)
100 student studying in the class. We have to store 100 id's.
int a[] = new int[100]  (0 to 99)

a[1] represent 0th data
a[2] represent 1st data

to represent the data what we can do? by using Index, we can access.

String s ="Welcome" //holds multiple value
chat s = 'w' //holds single value


Choosing the right data type based upon the size of data

byte	1 byte		stores whole numbers from -128 to 127
short	2 bytes		stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,768
int		4 bytes		stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,648
long	8 bytes		Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
float	4 bytes		Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 7 decimal digits
double	8 bytes		Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits
boolean	1 bit		Stores true or false values
char	2 bytes		Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values


saving long X = 100 instead of int X = 100, unnecessarily the memory will be loss

NOTE:
Variable and Constant
Variable -> Holds the data [ex: int a = 100;] some time it may change [int a = 200]
using final that value should not change in future. 
final int a = 100;


NOTE: Interview
JAVA is statically typed programming language
PYTHON is dynamically typed programming language

	int  x = 100;
	x="welcome" --->in JAVA it is not allowed, we can change the value x = 200 but we can't change the data type
	
	but in Python it is allowed. In Python we don't need to specify the data type. We don't need to specify  data type expicitly.  
	It will automatically identify the data type by the value.
	x = 100, here Python will automatically treated X as an integer.
	x = "Welcome" here Python will automatically treated X as an String.

In JAVA, once we created the variable with one data type we cannot store other data type in the same variable.
In PYTHON, based on the data which we have added the data type is automatically assigned to that variable.
