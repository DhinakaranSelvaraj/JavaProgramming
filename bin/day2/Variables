Java Variables and Data Types


Variables -> It is a container which can hold some data to represent data we need variables.
Ex:-  X=100, X=200, name = dhina
[X is a variable and 100 is the value or data]



Data type - It represent what type of data we are going to store in variable.
int X = 100, String name = dhina, float price = 15.25
Without data type we can't define variable

NOTE: String is a collection of characters

int X = 100;
float itemprice = 10.52
int age = 26
String name = "Dhina"
char grade = 'A'

NOTE: In Java every statement end with the semicolan

To create the variable in Java We have to specify the data type and variable 
ex: int a;  //Declaration
	a=100; //assignment
	
We can't define again int a = 100; it shows syntax error. bcz we already declare the data type.
int a = 100; //declaration+assignment


[	int a; // declaration
		a = 100; // assignment
		int a1 = 100; // declaration+assignment

		System.out.println(a);
		System.out.println(a1);
		System.out.println("a");
		
		a= 200; // Value of the variable is changed
		
		System.out.println(a);
]

The value of the variable can also vary.
We can always change the values of the variable whenever it is needed.


		// Approach 1
		int a = 100; int b = 200; int c = 300; //if all variable are belongs to diff data type

		// Approach 2
		int a, b, c;
		a = 100; b = 200; c = 300;  //this is for variables with same data type

		//Approach 3
		int a = 100, b= 200, c = 300; //this is for variables with same data type

// Printing Values using Concatenation
		System.out.println("the value of A is:"+a); //Concatenation
		System.out.println("the value of B is:"+b);
		System.out.println("the value of C is:"+c);
		
		//Single statement for print all the values
		
		System.out.println(a+b+c); //it will perform addition
		
		//Ans
		System.out.println(a+" "+b+" "+c);
