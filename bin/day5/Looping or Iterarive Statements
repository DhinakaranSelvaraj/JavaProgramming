Looping / Iterative Statements
-------------------------------

Looping is not bug set of or group of statements which we are going to execute multiple times or repetitively

Type - 3
	1. While loop
	2. Do While loop
	3. For loop
	
	another one is enhanced for loop (For each loop - specially designed for collections)
	
Use of Loop:
	
	
Advantage:
	1. Avoid Duplication
	2. Reduce the code
	
Important 3 things
	1. Where exactly the starting point (Initialization)
	2. How many times we have to repeat (Condition)
	3. Incrementation/Decrementation (How much value we are going to increamen/decrement in every iteration)
	
	EX: Req to print 1 to 10
	1 is a starting point (initialization) i=1, i<=10 (Condition), i++ (Increment)

1. While Loop
-------------
	syntax:- 
		while(condition)
		{
		statements;
		inc/dec;
		}

2. Do While loop
----------------
	Syntax:-
		do
		{
		statements;
		inc/dec
		} while(condition); semicolon is important

It will execute the statement at least one time then it will check the condition.

3. For Loop
-----------
Advantage
	1. We can specify initialization, condition and inc/dec in single line.
	2. Reduce code

	Syntax:-
		for(initialization; condition; inc/dec)
		{
		statement;
		}
		
Initialization is the first step, after initialization it will check the condition. If the condition is true it will execute the statement. after executing the statement it will increment/decrement the value.
After increment/decrement it will check the condition again and execute the statement.

Which loop is preferred to use
-----------------------------
* If you know the number of iterations in advance, the for loop is often the most suitable.
* If you want to execute the loop at least once, the do while loop is appropriate
* If you are uncertain about the number of iterations and the loop termination is based in a condition, the while loop is good choice.

Bike --- Source, Destination, Fuel -> For Loop
Bus --- First get into the bus then buy ticket -> Do While
Flight --- Have to buy ticket first then get into the flight -> First condition will be satisfied then statement will be executed
