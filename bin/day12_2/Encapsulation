Encapsulation
-------------

Wrapping up of data and methods into single unit(Class). //data means variables

We create variable using Private Access Modifier.  

For every variable we create 2 different method for setting and getting the values from the variable.

Setters -> To set the data in the variable through method
Getters-> To get the data from the variable through method

We can use that variable only within the class.

	1. All variable should be private
	2. For every variable there should be 2 methods(Get & Set)
	3. Variables can be operated only through methods.
