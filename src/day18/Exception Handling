Exception Handling
-------------------

Error is different, Exception is different.
	Exception is an event which will cause program termination.(User Mistake)
	
Errors:(Dev Mistake)
	1) Syntax Error (Semi-collan, Typo mistake) - Program cannot execute
	2) Logical Error - Execute program but output is incorrect
	
Types of Exception:
--------------------
	1) Checked Exceptions - TryCatch block and Throws, Method level declaration
		The Exceptions which are identified by java compiler
			Ex:- InteruptedException
				 FileNotFound
				 IOException etc..
	
	2) Un-Checked Exceptions - TryCatch block, Statement level Declaration
		The exceptions which are not identified by java compiler
			Ex:- ArithmeticException
				 NullPointerException
				 ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException etc..
				 
Reason for Exception:
	1) When user provided invalid input there is a chance of getting exception
	2) Once exception is occurred then program will be terminated and rest of the code is not executed
	
	
try
{
statement
}
catch(ArithmeticExeption e)
{
statements
} 





try
{
statement
}
catch()
{
}
finally	//always execute whether we get exception or not
{
//closing the connection, closing file
}

case1: Exception occured, catch block handled --> Finally block will execute
case2: Exception occured, catch block NOT handled --> Finally block will execute
case3: Execution does not occured, catch block ignored --> Finally block will execute


Checked exception can be handled by two ways
	1) Try Catch
	2) Throws
