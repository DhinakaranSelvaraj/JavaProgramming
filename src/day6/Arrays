Array
-----

What is an Array?
	Array is an collection of elements of same data type(Homogeneous data) - Heterogeneous[Contains different data type]
	We can store multiple values into a single variable.
	
Array Declaration

	int a[] = new int[5];

	Every location is identified by using index, index number start with 0.
	0,1,2,3,4
	
	if maximum number of element is n [5], then index is n-1 [5-1]
	
	if we want to store some values we can define like
	a[0] = 100;
	a[1] = 200;
	a[2] = 300;
	a[3] = 400;
	a[4] = 500;
	a[5] = 500; shows error:- Array index out of bound exception
	
	if we want to get particular value from any index we can print the index
	sys.println(a[1]);
	
2 types of Array:
	1. Single Dimensional - Create rows
	2. Two Dimensional/Multi-Dimensional - Create rows along with columns
	
	
1. Single Dimensional	- Row only
---------------------
	*Declare an array
	*Add values into array
	*Find length of an array
	*Read single value from an array
	*Read multiple value from an array
	
2. Two Dimensional		- Row along with column
---------------------
	*Declare an array
	*Add values into array
	*Find length of an array
	*Read single value from an array
	*Read multiple value from an array
	
Assignment:
	1. Find Sum of an Array
	a={1,2,3,4,5}
	Sum=15

	2. Print Even and Odd numbers from array
	a={1,2,3,4,5,6}
	Even = 3
	Odd = 3
