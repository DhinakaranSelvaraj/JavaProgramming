Encapsulation
-------------

Wrapping up of data and methods into single unit(Class). //data means variables

We create variable using Private Access Modifier.  

Setters -> To set the data in the variable through method
Getters-> To get the data from the variable through method

For every variable we create 2 different method for setting and getting the values from the variable.
