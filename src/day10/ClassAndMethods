Object Oriented Programming
---------------------------

Major 6 Concepts - If any languages which supports this all concepts is called as OOPS Language
	1. Class
	2. Object
	3. Polymorphism
	4. Encapsulation
	5. Inheritance
	6. Data Abstraction
	
Class - It is a collection of attributes and behavior
			Animal(Class) -----> Dog, Elephant, Horse, etc...(Object)
			Student(Class) ----> Kim, Dhina, Aravinth, Pradip...(Object)
			Employee(Class) ---> John, Smith, Mary(Object)
	
*Class -> Non physical, Object -> Physical
*Class is a plan or blueprint.
*One Class have multiple Objects.
*A group of objects are called as Class.
*A class is a virtual entity and a object is a physical entity.
*Object is derived from the class, without class there is no objects.
*Object is an instance of the class.
*In Java, attributes are called variables and Behaviors means methods.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Class
---------
	*Class is collection of variables and methods
	*Class is logical entity/blue print 
	*It will not occupy space in the memory

Syntax:
	class Employee
	{
	variable
	method
	}
	
	
2. Object
----------	
	*We can create an object only if we have an class, without class we have not create an object
	*Object should be created within the Main method
	*Object is an instance of a class / Object will be created by using class
	*Object is a physical entity, it will occupy memory
	*We can create N number of Object for a single class
	
	We cannot access the methods and variable straightly, only through the object we can access variables and methods.
	
Syntax:
	Employee emp1 = new Employee();
	Employee emp2 = new Employee();
	Employee emp3 = new Employee();
	
Class ----> Variables & Methods

Methods --> Variables
