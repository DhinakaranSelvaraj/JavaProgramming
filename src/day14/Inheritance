Inheritance
------------

Aquiring all the properties(Variable) and behaviour (Methods) from one class to another class is called Inheritance.

Using variable and methods from one class to another. 

Ex:- Class B extends variables, Methods from Class A

Class A - Parent, Base class, Super class

Class B - Child, Sub, Derived class


Objective:
	1. Re-usability
	2. Avoid Duplication
	
Types of Inheritance
	-Single Inheritance - One Parent, One child
	-Multi-level Inheritance - One parent having one child, that child having another, etc..
	-Hierarchy Inheritance - One parent have multiple child
	--------Cannot implement using Class, by implement using Interface----------
	-Multiple Inheritance - Multiple parent having single child
	Why?
		Extend support only one class, not support multiple classes
		Ambiguity issue will come, If 2 different parent having same variable, the child class will confuse to choose variable from different parent class. 
		Object is the default class in Java automatically other class extends methods from Object Class.
