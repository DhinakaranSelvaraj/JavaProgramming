DATA ABSTRACTION
-----------------

Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the users.

We can achieve Abstraction by two concepts
	1) Abstract Class - We cannot achieve 100% Abstraction
	2) Interface - We can achieve 100% Abstraction

Interface:
----------
1. An interface is a blue print of class.
2. Interface contains final and Static variables
3. Interface contains abstract methods (Also allowed default methods & Static methods from java8 onwards)
4. An Abstract method is a method contains signature but not body(Un-implemented method)
5. Methods in interface are public
6. Interface supports the functionality of multiple inheritance.
7. We can define interface with interface keyword.
8. A class extends another class, an interface extends another interface but a class implements an interface.(Interface - Abstract Method)[Interface cannot extends Class]
9. We can create object reference for interface but we cannot instantiate interface.



OOPS
----
1. Class
2. Object
3. Polymorphism ---> Overloading
4. Encapsulation ---> Setters & Getters
5. Inheritance ---> Overriding
6. Data Abstraction ---> Interface, Abstract class
